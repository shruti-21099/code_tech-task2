To build a calculator app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you first need to create a simple user interface with buttons for numbers (0-9), operations +, -, *,etc a clear button ac, and an equal button (=) to compute results. The display area should show user inputs and calculated results. This structure is defined in HTML, ensuring each button has an event listener for interaction.

For styling, CSS helps enhance the calculator’s look by setting a background color, aligning buttons, and making the UI visually appealing. JavaScript then handles the logic—capturing button clicks, 
updating the display, performing calculations, and handling edge cases like division by zero. Using the eval() function (with precautions) or a custom parser, the app can compute and display results dynamically, creating a smooth user experience.
